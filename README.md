# Ricca furniture design

The non-profit association Front End Development South Africa ([FEDSA](https://fedsa.org/)) organises mentoring sessions for aspiring developers. As part of this programme, I worked on a project to build the front page of a fictitious furniture company.

**Stack used**: HTML - CSS - JavaScript - Figma - Netlify

## The brief

There were detailed instructions for the assignment, in the form of a kanban board with cards for each feature. 
- The design was given in the form of a Figma file - see a PDF version of it in the root folder of this project.
- The page had to be built mobile-first, with media queries to adapt the design to larger screens.
- The product data is rendered dynamically, based on an API fetch to the 'backend' of this fictitious company.
- Clicking the shopping basket of one of the items updates the cart total at the bottom of the page.
- Clicking the heart icon on one of the items updates the icon to show as liked.
- I used the kanban board to track my progess on the project, creating a new branch for each feature and submitting pull requests to the Github repo upon completion.
